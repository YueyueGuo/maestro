# Barcode Scanning Testing Guide

## Overview
This guide provides comprehensive testing procedures for the barcode scanning feature in Maestro, implementing the strategy designed by our PWA Testing Specialist.

## Quick Start Testing

### 1. **Basic Functionality Test**
Navigate to `/capture` and verify:
- [ ] Camera opens automatically
- [ ] Barcode viewfinder appears with dashed rectangle
- [ ] Real-time scanning starts immediately

### 2. **Standard Barcode Tests**
Test with these reliable barcodes:

**High-Quality Products** (should work perfectly):
- `049000028911` - Coca-Cola Classic
- `3017620425035` - Nutella
- `012000005084` - Pepsi

**Medium-Quality Products** (may have some missing data):
- `041415084094` - Store brand water
- `041303002926` - Generic crackers

**Error Handling Tests**:
- `123456789012` - Invalid barcode (should show fallback options)
- `12345` - Malformed barcode (should show validation error)

## Comprehensive Testing Checklist

### **Functional Testing**

#### ✅ Core Barcode Scanning
- [ ] **Auto-detection**: Barcode detected within 3 seconds in good lighting
- [ ] **Product lookup**: API call completes within 2 seconds
- [ ] **Quality scoring**: Products show quality badges (High/Medium/Low)

   - [ ] User-friendly error messages
   - [ ] Alternative methods suggested

### **User Experience Testing**

#### 🎯 **Real-World Scenarios**

**Grocery Shopping Flow**:
1. Scan 5 different products in sequence
2. Test with curved packages, small barcodes
3. Verify under store lighting conditions
4. Check one-handed operation

**Kitchen Pantry Flow**:
1. Scan items with damaged/dirty barcodes
2. Test with packages at different angles
3. Verify works with phone case/screen protector

#### ♿ **Accessibility Testing**
- [ ] **Screen reader**: VoiceOver/TalkBack compatibility
- [ ] **High contrast**: Visible in accessibility mode
- [ ] **Large text**: UI scales with system font size
- [ ] **Motor accessibility**: Large touch targets (44px minimum)

### **PWA-Specific Testing**

#### 📲 **Installation Testing**
1. **Install flow**:
   - [ ] PWA installable from browser
   - [ ] Camera permissions persist after install
   - [ ] Works in standalone mode

2. **Update handling**:
   - [ ] Service worker updates don't break camera

## Automated Testing Integration

### **API Integration Tests**
Run these commands to validate backend integration:

```bash
# Test with standard barcodes
npm run test:api:barcodes

# Test error handling
npm run test:api:errors

# Test quality scoring
npm run test:quality-scoring
```

### **Performance Monitoring**
```javascript
// Check memory usage during scanning
console.log('Memory usage:', performance.memory?.usedJSHeapSize)

// Monitor API response times
console.log('API timing:', performance.getEntriesByType('measure'))
```

## Success Criteria

### **MVP Requirements (Must Pass)**
- [ ] >85% success rate for clear, well-lit barcodes
- [ ] <5 second end-to-end scan-to-display time
- [ ] No crashes on common error conditions
- [ ] Works on iPhone 13+ and Samsung Galaxy S22+

### **Quality Targets**
- [ ] <10% task abandonment rate
- [ ] User can operate with one hand
- [ ] Works in typical grocery store lighting
- [ ] Clear recovery options for all error states

## Common Issues & Solutions

### **Camera Not Starting**
1. Check HTTPS requirement (camera requires secure context)
2. Verify permissions in browser settings
3. Test with different browsers (Chrome has best support)
4. Check for conflicting camera usage

### **Barcode Not Detected**
1. Ensure adequate lighting
2. Test barcode with known working examples
3. Check barcode is in viewfinder frame
4. Verify barcode format supported (UPC-A, EAN-13, etc.)

### **Poor Performance**
1. Monitor memory usage in DevTools
2. Check network speed and API response times
3. Test on actual mobile devices (not browser emulation)
4. Verify resource cleanup working correctly

### **Error Boundary Issues**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify error boundaries catch and display properly
3. Test recovery options work as expected
4. Ensure fallback options are available

## Testing Schedule

### **Pre-Launch (Current)**
- [ ] All functional tests passing
- [ ] Primary device matrix validated
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Error handling comprehensive

### **Post-Launch Monitoring**
- Monitor user success rates
- Track error frequencies
- Analyze performance metrics
- Collect user feedback

## Reporting Issues

When reporting issues, include:
1. **Device/Browser**: Specific model and version
2. **Barcode**: Which barcode was being scanned
3. **Environment**: Lighting, network conditions
4. **Steps**: Exact reproduction steps
5. **Expected vs Actual**: What should have happened
6. **Console logs**: Any error messages in developer tools
